line  i wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over 750 in books around  i came out at well under 500 considering i bought this   great alternative to college textbooks', 'my only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps i use in my phone   i like the kindle fire very much ', 'i had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other

solid tablet with potential', 'great inexpensive tablet for everyday use  its not powerful enough for super graphical games but its great for basic apps like surfing the web  emails  news  etc  amazon

all-in-all  its a great tablet that you dont have to worry about if you break it   great tablet', 'great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet  it is very fast at everything accept game play  for example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable  the graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games  also it is a amazon tablet with no google play store but you can load google play on to it  there are great you tube videos on how to put google play on a amazon tablet  the screen is good as long as the sun isnt hitting it  the stereo speakers sound great and loud  all in all i really liked the tablet for the price but i really like to play games with good graphic quality  so that being said i did return this tablet and ordered the nvidia shield 8 inch tablet through best buy for 199 dollars  i got the shield a week ago and wow what a difference in graphic gaming quality  this thing is just as good as an xbox1 or ps4  the nvidia shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the apple or samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost  plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv  the amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period i dont know why bbuy kind of hides the nvidia tab only on their website and doesnt sell it in the store  if they displayed it in the store  this would outsell the apple or samsung tablets  i hope this helps thanks   great tablet at a

for me  i was spoiled by the retina display on the ipad  the 720p display is alright  but you can see the pixels  189ppi is pretty low by todays standards  the other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display  its glare city on this thing  display nitpicks aside  it punches above its price point  if you dont play really heavy games  which it even plays titan quest surprisingly well  and

between ram and regular storage  the internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times  even when all my other wifi devices ran great  then a day would pass and id be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working   wtf come to find out its a known issue and theyre working on it  after two weeks of one thing after another i got fed up and just returned it  i wanted it to work  and gave it a good run  but just not quality stuff  to me it was like walmart trying to build their own computer when theyre obviously not a computer manufacturer  neither is amazon  if i were you id look at a regular android tablet from a reputable pc manufacturer  which is exactly what i did next  i got an asus tablet for only a few dollars more  and its unbelievable  1000 better in

been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content  i found the 7 fire kids edition  but after looking over the specs and reviews  i found myself unsure of it  i was mostly interested in the freetime application  so i did some research on that and found that it was available on other fire models also  i came across the new fire hd8  which had more power  a better screen  and far better battery life at a very affordable price point  i gave them a shot and im glad i did i have the fire hd8s locked into freetime mode  so the only activities that can be done are ones that i approve of  but if i want to  i can pick up either of them and unlock them to access netflix amazon prime or anything else i desire  i currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games  and those are limited to x amount of time per day  freetime also has a bedtime feature which disables enables the use of the tablets during designated times  which is amazing the hardware itself is exceptional  the screen resolution is excellent  its very responsive  and the battery life is spectacular they advertise up to 12 hours of battery life  and depending on screen brightness  ours last almost that long regularly  the only con i can think of is that the cameras are sub-par  but thats not what i purchased the tablets for  so its a non-issue for myself some of the reviews i read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with freetime content  so i installed 128gb sd cards in them  i also purchased some rugged childrens cases for them off of amazon this is probably one of the best purchases i have made in a long time  the sound of silent children reading all day is priceless  excellent product',

the black friday sale  at the time i felt it was a steal at that price  the first tablet i purchased a few years ago was the original kindle fire  the following year i purchased an ipad mini and now have the ipad mini 4  as you may already know  the ipad does not have explandable memory  this kindle can have expanded memory to 200gb so that was a good selling point for me  after setting this new kindle fire up  i noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original ipad mini even without retina display  and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it  some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to  im a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me  i was not expecting perfection with the colors but peoples skin tones appeared greenish as if they were vulcans  i also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in pdf format  the kindle will read this format but the kindle fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books  etc ; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead  if you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book  that was enough for me  ive been spoiled by the ease of use of the ipad and the display with accurate colors  back to the store for a prompt refund it went  overall  still a good deal but if you are used to an ipad for the reasons i am  you may be disappointed   just ok for the price', 'works well  but does not offer access to the apple or android app store

 and many things apple  second  i also own many android devices  the main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes amazon prime  over all i would purchase this over an ipad mini any day just for the value alone  at first i thought the display wouldnt be up to snuff compared to my ipad  but for movies and reading  it was good enough that it doesnt take away from the experience  however  there are a few annoying features that are on but can and should be turned off  the on-deck is a great feature  but i would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background  eating up space and bandwidth  a better function would have been to let us choose what to download  instead of getting movies willynilly  be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow  and youll be thinking the tablet is slow  ok on to kindle for reading  unfortunately  reading isnt as great as i thought it would be because it doesnt

controls child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers crush the built in speakers on my ipad air 2  the only drawbacks i have found so far are power related  the battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what i would consider normal use and the included charger  typical usb type  takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet  i suspect this is the chargers limitation
