of the books  why couldnt they just leave the home page showing the small pictures of the books you bought i have no idea what my reading list is - it lists books ive never heard of  by authors and

bad i usually just turn it off becuase most of my reading is done in daylight  all in all great but not perfect  and if your into occult reads like i am be ready to fork out the  for them  the selection does leave some to be desired but not bad  i give the kindle store for books a 3 out of 5  if your not a serious reader 3+ books a week imo  i i would go with a voyage or if you can stick to

soon expunged  i have always read books  then as i grew older and my eye sight grew worse  i moved to reading on my ipad air because i could increase the size of the print  the downside to my ipad though  was that it would get heavy to hold as i read  and after a while i would get some eye strain from the light being projected out from the device  even in night mode to a point  even though that was much better  so i decided to try the kindle paperwhite with the new 300 ppi type  i couldnt be happier with it  its light to hold  even in one hand  which i do a lot  i can still adjust the type size to what i want  the type is very crisp and easy to read  and i find that i dont get the eye strain that i used to  one other benefit to the kindle is that reading outside is even better than reading inside  which can not be said for the ipad another benefit to the kindle is that if i still feel like reading the book for a while on my ipad  using the free kindle app  my ipad syncs perfectly with my kindle  so that it will start on the same page that i stopped on with my kindle  so that i can seamlessly move from one device to the other the only slight disappointment that i had with it  was that the battery doesnt last as long as they lead you to believe  i found myself having to recharge it about two thirds the way through the book  but realistically thats no big deal to me

'with this 3rd generation of the kindle paperwhite  amazon really created the best reading experience for a reasonable price  i previously owned a first generation paperwhite  and the increase in resolution  300ppi  up from 212ppi  is really noticeable  after reading on this for a while  it is slightly disturbing to see jagged edges around text of the older paperwhite  the white balance of the screen has also improved  with a slightly warmer  book-ish experience instead of the cooler  electronic-display-ish screen of the old on  additionally  the screen can get crazy low in brightness ideal for someone who prefers to read in bed at night with the lights turned off   if you thought the previous kindles got dark  this takes it to a whole new level of dimness   the best e-book reading experience', 'the new version has 300ppi  which is the same as the voyage  there is no reason to pay for extra 80 just for the page press   best choice in the market', 'i used to read with my ipad   but there was always a glare in the car and even in my house when the sun was coming in the window  the paperwhite takes care of all glare problems i had  so now i can read whenever and wherever i

great to be able to read into the night - the fact that it is backlit is great  very happy with purchase', 'i love the kindle   reading is so much easier especially traveling and at beach  awesome', 'this review comes with a caveat  many tech sites say e-readers are dying  kind of like the nintendo is doooooomed crowd  or the gps is obsolete argument  i dont disagree  as our phones become more sophisticated and the phone screen sizes continue to balloon up to tablet-like proportions  dedicated devices will continue to go the way of the dodo  but sometimes  if youre interested enough  a dedicated device is precisely what you need  i had  key word: had  an ipad mini 2 that i had been using as my all-round in-bed netflix + reading machine  except id get about 3 seconds in before getting nudged by my wife due to half the room being lit up  as i spend more time reading on my ipad than watching netflix  i decided to sell my ipad mini and just buy 2 kindles - one for my wife and myself  the new kindle paperwhite feels just as solid as the outgoing model  but the resolution is now 300 dpi  the e-ink screen almost feels like a page of a paperback when you swipe  and in my personal preference  i like that the battery is rated to last 6-8 weeks on average between the various tech sites  which trumps my ipad mini by several life cycles  yes the screen has to refresh unlike a tablet  but its not very noticeable and i dont find it distracting at all for reading cases arent nearly as ubiquitous as for the ipad  so youve basically got the standard amazon-branded leather case or offbrand cases from sites like ebay i enjoy reading  and i frankly dont want to wear any thicker glasses than i already have  backlight can cause bad eye strain  so thats another plus for the kindle over the ipad in summary  tl;dr: if you want a dedicated e-reader  you cant go wrong with the kindle pw  the price:performance ratio is much better than the voyage imho but thats assuming that youre somebody who spends enough time reading to make the kindle device worth carrying  if you only read for a few seconds here and there  adding an extra device to lug around isnt for you  so like a garmin  the market has a specific niche and ymmv depending on your needs  for me  the kindle was a great fit   excellent e-reader', 'this is a great reader and has lots of new features

app on an ipad and android tablet and phone and i love it  this is my first kindle device  so i cant compare it to previous kindle versions  the only drawback to using the kindle app on the previoulsy-mentioned devices is that they cant be seen in direct sunlight  and that is the biggest advantage i see to owning a kindle--you can read outside in daylight  also  the kindle is very light and portable and easy to use  it does what it says it will do and you cant beat the battery life  the x-ray feature is also a bonus that you dont get with the app   great for what it is', 'i use it

the screen is much more exquisite  the whole materials is not that plastic feel any more  i just love it  the only regret is that  a few days after my made the purchase  there is the 10 saving promotion     must have for some who likes to read', 'this is my first ereader  ive wanted one for awhile but wasnt impressed with features until the two most recent versions of paperwhite were released  i have the latest version   ive read a few books and several magazines on it  so at this point im familiar with it  basic functionality is excellent  for reading text its pretty straightforward; magazine articles with images worked well for me  but i can see where screen formatting could be an issue for more complex illustrations  the backlight is very good  i wouldnt buy an ereader without it   pages flips are lightening fast  and the touch screen is mostly quite responsive with minimal pressure  i have a few complaints  see below   nice integration with the amazon leather cover  you can just close the book and it shuts down  buying books from amazon is simple  and they are delivered via my home wifi in seconds  battery life seems endless  and recharge is simple  the included cable charges via a pc  wall charger is an accessory you must purchase   great device for older readers  as you can kick up the font size and lighting for squint-free reading  its about the size of a small paperback book and as light as a feather my complaints: 1  ads are mildly annoying  its aggravating to pay more for an ad-free version; 2  availability of books from my local library remain shockingly limited  even though these devices are hardly new; 3  the amazon library for book loans  available for a monthly fee  is also very limited  i had a 30-day trial period  during which time i searched for several classic novels on both amazon and my local library -- big fat zero across the board for my entire reading list  want to read catch-22 or atlas shrugged youve got to buy it  ; 4  highlighting is clumsy using a finger  although ive improved over time  changing the highlighted area by dragging the electronic tabs is useless; 5  if you like to flip through a book  the paperwhite will take you to the furthest page touched when you reopen the book  if youve read 50 pages  but went forward to see something on pages 180-190  youll return to 191 next time  if you flip around a lot youll get a real mess  manual bookmarks are the only solution  6  its my understanding that when you buy a book from amazon  you are getting a license to read that book on an amazon device only  you are not getting a generic ebook that will work forever on any device   so if you buy a different brand of ereader 5 years from now youll have to rebuy your library despite all this  im glad i bought it and would recommend it if youd like a dedicated ereader versus a tablet   love it  but not perfect', 'i bought this as a replacement for my wifes old kindle 3g  i got the wifi version only since she rarely used the 3g  i have to say that this version is much nicer in some ways and is lacking in others  my wife really misses the physical keyboard  but she has quickly gotten used to the touch-screen  the dpi is much better  and the screen is much easier to read  the refresh times are a lot better  i dont see there being a need to upgrade if yours is currently

charge for weeks  i have a pretty big collection of physical books  but i really enjoy having a library on a tablet that i can bring with me too  i buy physical books when i want to linger around a book store  or for poetry  or books that i want to high light or share with people  or that i like the covers of  i buy kindle books that i really want for the story  or that are on sale on the kindle

charge  if you love books you have to get one of these my house would be full of books  but now i can get books i would not otherwise purchase because of physical space limitations  i have over 100

300ppi screen the paperwhite really hits the sweet spot in the kindle lineup   the new screen is amazing', 'purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation kindle paperwhite  the backlight is greatly improved  the display is of a higher quality  the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker  opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier the one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation paperwhite is the way its manufactured  when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen  you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen  at first i thought this was a manufacturing defect  so i took it back to best buy and exchanged it for the same model  only to find that the second model had the same issue  except more-visible this appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process  when the paperwhite first came out  it was the crown jewel of amazons e-reader line  and amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices  now  that honor falls to the more-expensive voyage  with the paperwhite becoming the flagship  but still cheaper  option in the kindle lineup  meaning the manufacturing quality of the paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the voyage this wont be a huge annoyance for some people  it is for me  and its seriously made me consider whether its worth contacting amazon over for everyone else  though  this is a great e-reader and well worth the money  if youre looking for an e-reader  this is the one to buy   good  but one small thing annoys me   ', 'perfect size  great in all lighting situations  easy to hold  handle and transport

find before buying this newest paperwhite and what struck me the most was the contrast of the bright screen versus the print  however  when i got mine  i had to put the brightness level to 19  out of 25  to get it to a comfortable setting  doing that makes my battery run down before ive even read two books  and that is with the airplane setting on  meaning the wifi is off  luckily  i bought a charger so i can charge my paperwhite while on trips   without my computer  in a regular outlet  or at night when im finished reading  now for the positives  i love the light weight of this kindle even with the preferred cover that shuts it into sleep mode when closed  i absolutely love the dictionary feature  because it is so easy to use and it saves the words i dont know  for study  after ive learned a words meaning  i can delete it from the list  i got the paperwhite with the ads  because it is nice getting suggestions of books i might enjoy that i might not see otherwise  and books are easy to order from the kindle store and to download through this devise  i like the cover  because it protects the screen from scratches while stored in my purse and i also purchased a stylus to keep

for  i havent contacted amazon about this  but it seems odd  on other books  it works as expected  one other thing to keep in mind if you have an older kindle is that it will need to be recharged more

would happen; then came the kindle paperwhite  i think i have read close to 10 books this past month because of the paperwhite i can make the font larger  which is great for my old eyes   and it is lit from the side  so it does not make my eyes tired like typical lcd screens  where the light shoots up at your eyes  because of this  you can read easily in bright sun or in total darkness  also  the battery lasts a very long time; i usually have to charge it only after reading a full book  and an added bonus is that you cant get any apps on the paperwhite  which sounds like a negative  but that means there is no distraction temptation to surf the web instead of read  when you open it up  you are committed to reading  it is sooooo much better than my nook  which makes my eyes tired and is a distraction it is among the best purchases i have ever made  i love reading again', 'its a reader  wanted to get the cheeper one but you were out of stock  this one works well  reader', 'great to

reader', 'the paperwhite is an excellent product  it is very lightweight  easy to hold for long periods of time  and user-friendly  software wise   be prepared to have a slower reaction time than a typical tablet  or amazon fire ; this is because of the e-ink  however  i will take the trade off  as you are able to read e-ink in every environment  sunlight  dark rooms  without any eyestrain -- something that is not possible with a regular tablet  screen response time is only slightly delayed because of this if you have a prime membership  you have access to all of amazons library  which has a large selection; however  most disappointingly  you can only rent one book per month unless you upgrade to amazons kindle app  which is an additional 10 month  i find this to be mildly frustrating

like most about the kindle paperwhite: the adjustable screen lighting is spot on and easy on my eyes  whether i am reading in dim room light or bright sunshine outside; the ease of syncing it with my computer and wifi; the speed of downloading a book; the ability to adjust the font size; the ability to bookmark and pick up from where i stopped reading; and the size and weight which makes it very portable  i opted for an envelop-style sleeve for storage rather than a cover you might use for an ipad or similar tablet  its easy to slip the reader out of the sleeve and begin reading  i am

sending a email with convert in subject line and including the attachment and sending it to your kindle email  refer to amazon settings for finding out your kindle email   however it may lose the tables or other code diagrams from the original pdf so that is a pain  varies from pdf to pdf   also if you are used to ios or android  the page turns are not the same like flipping  when you tap or perform a page flip it will blink for a sec and refresh the page to move to next page  i found this a little annoying but it works  if you buy a book online then that might be a better option as it

read when im out and about  waiting at a doctors office  or in-line at a restaurant  etc  it became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best e-reader is the one you have with you at all times  for me  thats my iphone the actual reading experience is definitely better on the paperwhite  however  if youre an on-the-go reader like me  then it just means you have to carry around another device

sunlight  plus  with the ipad you can play games  web search  etc  the kindle library function is not nearly as good as the kindle app on the ipad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the kindle  i also do not like the page turn of the kindle versus apple  every page turned on kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely  i actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the kindle slow page turn  even the reading in the outdoors feature of the kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with  although at least you can read with it outdoors  the kindle also suffers from a shadow along the bottom of the screen  the explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading  draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering  it is worse on some of the devices i saw than on others  kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged  i would never take an ipad to the beach  but the kindle is almost disposable in contrast  maybe 3 stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the ipad  if apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare  then i dont see any market for the kindle at that point  not sorry i have a kindle  but for what i decided to buy it for  reading at beach  it is at the price point where it is not really worth it  i still read paper books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading   not as great as reviewers rate it ', 'i have

else left on the eink market anyway but the amazon kindle  it still doesnt support epub format of course  amazon doesnt like competition  it is built ok  moderately cheap plastic  but no squeaking at least  contrast is ok  i had nook and it is on par  i cant imagine how bad the regular kindle would be though  this one with 300 dpi is just ok  scrolling is fast enough  it has integrated vocabulary  no home menu or other physical buttons though  besides the home kindle one - the ui is not completely responsive when you try to go to your library  instead home brings you to amazon kindle page  where you are overwhelmed with advertisement my biggest dislike is the volume of advertisement and thus the convoluted interface  it is way worse then nook  which is much more reading-centric a lot of

same screen resolution and was a lot cheaper  plus  a white model to match my other white silver gadgets it does have a few less leds for backlighting  no flush glass cover  but that is what broke   no auto-adjusting light  that never quite worked anyway   squeezy sides  and a tiny bit heavier bigger than the voyage  the voyage also has had no hardware updates since it was released and the new crazy-expensive kindle uses leather and has no not-leather option for people who dont like their high tech wrapped in animal skins  so instead of saving up for a while and reading on my phone  i sprung for the paperwhite ive been using this for about a month and the quality has impressed me  i dont miss the glass cover as much as i thought i would  although sometimes pet hair will get caught between the bezel and the screen and need to be pulled out  the screen is great  doesnt clash with the white casing  and although not quite as even a backlight as the voyage  still much better value for what you get  the software is essentially the same  and amazon has been slowly improving kindle software for all the recent models if you like amazon for books  i highly recommend this kindle  you cant beat it for price value and it really doesnt feel any heavier even after an hour or two curled up with your books   the latest paperwhite is a wonderful kindle', 'my husband prefers the paperwhite model over the voyager because it is easier for him to hold in his big fat fingers since it has a larger frame so more room for the fingers  and kindle paperwhite and voyager models are

someone in your house that does you have to setup a household and share everything to my wife so she was able to see all the books that i had purchased  i can be selective after they are shared   one thing i noticed was there is the kindle lending library  it only allows 1 book to be borrowed per month  recently amazon came up with prime reading  so you can take out multiple books at a time but

on the previous model  with text it is barely  if at all  noticeable  with any kind of graphics or cover images  the increase in resolution is nicer  unfortunately the lighting remains uneven at the bottom of the screen as it was in the previous generation  the voyager model supposedly has better lighting but at twice the price it wasnt worth it to me  and the uneven bottom lighting isnt bad  but it is there and i would have thought amazon would have fixed that by now  maybe it is a limitation of having 4 light sources vs the 6 on the voyager  still  the lighting is not bad and this is a very nice ereader  noticed the background is a touch more beige than the grey on the previous model which is a welcome subtle change  easier on the eyes  like too that the font is a dark grey versus pitch black which also reduces eye strain especially for those with dyslexia who can be sensitive to harsh contrasts  overall  highly recommended  best ereader for the price   excellent ereader', 'got this

seems like the left 10 at best and just to be safe i press on the very edge  i miss the buttons for turning pages i also miss the 3g even though i didnt use it all that often  now i just need to make

that moves up or down electronically  so it is literally an actual printed book page that can change in an instance i like the kindle paperwhite and it does everything i need  but this particular version doesnt have the same pleasing page color as my 5 year old kindle  which is strange  but i really needed the light to actually be able to read when i usually want to read  so when the light is on its pretty nice the interface is rather slow  which is to be expected given its not a traditional lcd screen  its literally a printing press   but i wish the interface had better ways to organize and change the order of books  the other problem i had was that the first one i received had a large hole in the upper layer of the screen  where the light diffuses through  so it had this glowing hole that reminded me of a giant stuck pixel  also there were a few random stuck black spots  the next one did not have these problems  amazon will replace it for you if it does   i love e-ink  the
