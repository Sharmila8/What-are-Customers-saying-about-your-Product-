# Project 3-Using unsupervised machine learning to identify popular features of a product from customer reviews


**Objective**

Online product reviews have been shown to be a viable source of information for helping customers make informed
purchasing decisions. In several cases, customers can rate products on a numerical scale, and also provide textual feedback pertaining a purchased product.Product attributes expressed online prove useful during the product development stage, as they serve as strong indicators of future outcomes when utilized in an efficient manner.Thus online customer reviews if mined and analyzed correctly can increase the chances of a products being successful in the market through a deeper understanding of market needs. The objective of my project is to identify the key features of a product that are popular among customers.

**Proposed Method**

**Data set**: Dataset of amazon online customer reviews. I plan to focus on one project category.
I will be using NLP to extract text from the online reviews and classify different features of a product based on adjective, adverb, verb, noun as opinion words and negation rules into positive and negative.I then plan to classify product features using unsupervised machine learning.
